This is a test document for the Multi-Bot RAG Platform document management system.

The document management system supports the following features:
1. Document upload with drag-and-drop functionality
2. Document listing with processing status
3. Document search and filtering
4. Document deletion with confirmation
5. Document viewer with chunk visualization

This document contains multiple paragraphs to test the chunking functionality of the system.

Features implemented:
- File validation (type and size checking)
- Multi-file upload support
- Real-time upload progress
- Integration with backend API endpoints
- Error handling and user feedback

The system processes documents by:
1. Extracting text content
2. Chunking text into smaller pieces
3. Generating embeddings for semantic search
4. Storing in vector database (Qdrant)

This allows users to chat with their documents and get intelligent responses based on the document content.
