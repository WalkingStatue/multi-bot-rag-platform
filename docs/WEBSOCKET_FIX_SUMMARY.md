# WebSocket Infinite Loop Fix Summary

## 🎯 Problem Solved
The WebSocket test `tests/test_websocket_api.py::TestWebSocketChatEndpoint::test_websocket_chat_successful_connection` was hanging indefinitely, causing the entire test process to freeze.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The issue was in the WebSocket endpoint implementation (`app/api/websocket.py`). The `while True:` loop in the message handling section had a flaw in its exception handling:

```python
# BEFORE (problematic code)
while True:
    try:
        data = await websocket.receive_text()
        # ... process message ...
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error processing WebSocket message: {e}")
        await websocket.send_text(json.dumps({
            "type": "error",
            "message": "Error processing message"
        }))
        # ❌ Loop continues even if websocket is broken!
```

When the mock WebSocket in tests raised exceptions repeatedly, the exception handler would catch them, try to send an error message, but never break out of the loop, creating an infinite loop.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Exception Handling in WebSocket Endpoints
Updated both `websocket_chat_endpoint` and `websocket_notifications_endpoint` in `app/api/websocket.py`:

```python
# AFTER (fixed code)
while True:
    try:
        data = await websocket.receive_text()
        # ... process message ...
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        logger.error("Invalid JSON received from WebSocket")
        try:
            await websocket.send_text(json.dumps({
                "type": "error",
                "message": "Invalid JSON format"
            }))
        except:
            # ✅ If we can't send error message, connection is broken - break loop
            break
    
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
        # ✅ Re-raise WebSocketDisconnect to be handled by outer try-catch
        raise
    
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error processing WebSocket message: {e}")
        try:
            await websocket.send_text(json.dumps({
                "type": "error",
                "message": "Error processing message"
            }))
        except:
            # ✅ If we can't send error message, connection is broken - break loop
            break
```

### 2. Added Timeout Protection in Tests
Added timeout mechanism to prevent infinite hanging in tests:

```python
# Add timeout to prevent infinite hanging
try:
    await asyncio.wait_for(
        websocket_chat_endpoint(mock_websocket, bot_id, token, mock_db),
        timeout=5.0  # 5 second timeout
    )
except asyncio.TimeoutError:
    pytest.fail("WebSocket endpoint test timed out - likely infinite loop")
```

### 3. Added Comprehensive Test Coverage
Created additional test to verify the fix handles repeated exceptions correctly:

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_websocket_no_infinite_loop_on_exception(self, ...):
    """Test that WebSocket doesn't hang on repeated exceptions."""
    # Mock WebSocket to raise exceptions repeatedly, then disconnect
    # Verify the endpoint handles this gracefully without infinite loop
```

## 🧪 Test Results

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Test would hang indefinitely
- ❌ Required manual interruption (Ctrl+C)
- ❌ Blocked entire test suite

### After Fix:
- ✅ Test completes in ~2 seconds
- ✅ No infinite loops
- ✅ Proper error handling and cleanup
- ✅ All WebSocket tests pass

## 📊 Current Test Status

```bash
# WebSocket tests now pass successfully
docker compose exec backend pytest tests/test_websocket_api.py::TestWebSocketChatEndpoint -v

# Results:
# ✅ test_websocket_chat_successful_connection PASSED
# ✅ test_websocket_no_infinite_loop_on_exception PASSED  
# ✅ test_websocket_chat_authentication_failure PASSED
# ✅ test_websocket_chat_bot_access_denied PASSED
# ✅ test_websocket_chat_typing_message PASSED
# ✅ test_websocket_chat_ping_message PASSED
# ✅ test_websocket_chat_invalid_json PASSED
```

## 🔧 Key Improvements

1. **Robust Error Handling**: WebSocket endpoints now properly handle connection failures
2. **Loop Safety**: Exception handlers can break out of infinite loops when connections are broken
3. **Test Reliability**: Tests complete quickly and reliably
4. **Better Debugging**: Added timeout mechanisms to catch similar issues in the future

## 🚀 Impact

- **Development Velocity**: Tests run faster and don't hang
- **CI/CD Reliability**: Automated testing won't get stuck
- **Production Stability**: Better WebSocket error handling in production
- **Developer Experience**: No more manual test interruptions
