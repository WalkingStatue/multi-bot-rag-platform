# Project Organization Improvements

## What Was Changed

### ✅ Files Moved and Organized

**From Root Directory:**
- `test_*.py` files → `tests/integration/`
- Development notes (`*.md`) → `docs/development/`
- Removed virtual environment directory (`venv/`)

**From Backend Directory:**
- `test_*.py` files → `tests/integration/`
- `debug*.py` files → `tools/dev/`
- Documentation files → `docs/development/`

### ✅ New Directory Structure

```
multi-bot-rag-platform/
├── backend/                # Clean backend code only
├── frontend/              # Clean frontend code only
├── tests/                 # All tests organized
│   └── integration/       # Integration tests
├── docs/                  # All documentation
│   ├── development/       # Development notes
│   └── PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md
├── scripts/               # Utility scripts
│   ├── dev-setup.ps1     # Single setup script
│   └── test-runner.ps1   # Simple test runner
├── tools/                 # Development tools
│   └── dev/              # Debug scripts
├── config/               # Configuration templates
├── docker-compose.yml    # Single Docker setup
└── README.md            # Simplified documentation
```

### ✅ Simplified Scripts

**Single Setup Script:**
```powershell
.\scripts\dev-setup.ps1           # Basic setup
.\scripts\dev-setup.ps1 -Migrate  # With database migration
.\scripts\dev-setup.ps1 -Clean -Build -Migrate -Seed  # Full setup
```

**Simple Test Runner:**
```powershell
.\scripts\test-runner.ps1                    # All tests
.\scripts\test-runner.ps1 -TestType backend  # Backend only
.\scripts\test-runner.ps1 -Coverage          # With coverage
```

### ✅ Single Docker Environment

- No separate dev/test/prod Docker Compose files
- Single `.env` file for all environments
- Simplified configuration and maintenance

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Root Directory** - Only essential files at the top level
2. **Logical Organization** - Related files grouped together
3. **Simplified Scripts** - Single setup and test scripts
4. **Unified Environment** - One Docker Compose for all use cases
5. **Better Maintainability** - Easier to find and manage files
6. **Reduced Complexity** - No multiple environment configurations

## Usage

```powershell
# Quick start
.\scripts\dev-setup.ps1

# Run tests
.\scripts\test-runner.ps1

# Standard Docker commands still work
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f
docker compose down
```

The project is now much more organized and easier to navigate!
